# Welcome to CodeMaps
This project aims to bring an brand new approach to software development.
Thanks to the progress made in software, it is now possible to imagine a new way to code. No more deeply nested file tree arborescence and files with thousands of lines of code: time for code maps and graphical views !

# The benefits
## 1. Find yourself
When you are in a complex system, a whole load of files structured in a deeply nested arborescence (that we don't know by heart) or that a file contains thousands of lines, not only it takes a lot of time to find your code, but it is not an elegant solution to find it.

## 2. Abstract your code
The syntax and the text do not interest you when you are navigating in your codespace. See only what is pertinent to you, and as detailed or global as needed for you: the code of your variables and functions.

## 3. View the code in its entirety
Maps allow vizualizing more information at once, with a single view.

# How to install
This project is still in the conception phase. But it is intended to be easily installed. For now, the goal is to have a fully-functional VS Code extension, but other things can be considered in the future (extension for Visual Studio, JetBrains software, etc.)
